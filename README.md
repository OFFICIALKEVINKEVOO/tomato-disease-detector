# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection App

This is a web-based deep learning application that detects diseases in tomato leaves using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built with PyTorch and Streamlit, the app allows users to upload or take a photo of a tomato leaf and receive a prediction with confidence and treatment suggestions.

## 🚀 Features

* Upload or take a photo of a tomato leaf.
* Detect 3 classes:

  * Tomato\_healthy
  * Tomato\_Late\_blight
  * Tomato\_Septoria\_leaf\_spot
* Confidence score for predictions.
* Treatment recommendations for detected diseases.
* About tab with project overview and contact info.

## 🧠 Model

* Architecture: Custom CNN defined in `model.py`
* Framework: PyTorch
* Training: Done via `train_model.py`
* Evaluations include:

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion matrix (saved in `/models`)
  * Classification report
